          <p>Hello, World. My name is Antonio ðŸ‘‹</p>
          <p>
            I am an Electrical Engineering student at the Federal University of
            Juiz de Fora. I was introduced to programming in 2019, when I
            started studying algorithms and programming logic. In 2020 I started
            research into cancer treatment through the injection of magnetic
            nanoparticles into tumor tissue. I have C/C++, Python, Next, React,
            Node, Jquery, HTML and CSS skills.
